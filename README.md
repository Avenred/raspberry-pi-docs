# Raspberry Pi Help
This repo is a collection of docs I made for myself so I wouldn't forget how to use a Raspberry Pi. The repo is private for now, and I will only be adding friends to this repo since I don't want to mess up one of the docs with incorrect information and screw up someone elses Raspberry Pi.

Enjoy!
