# Raspberry Pi Docs
This repo is a collection of docs I made for myself so I wouldn't forget how to use a Raspberry Pi. **Some of the information on here may be incorrect, follow at your own risk! I am not responsible for any damage you have done to your Raspberry Pi**

If you use my work, I ask that you credit me. As this work is licensed under CC0, you don't have to, but it would be nice if you could :).

Pull requests are welcome!

Enjoy!
